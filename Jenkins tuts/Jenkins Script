script
The script step takes a block of Scripted Pipeline and executes that in the Declarative Pipeline. For most use-cases, the script step should be unnecessary in Declarative Pipelines, but it can provide a useful "escape hatch." script blocks of non-trivial size and/or complexity should be moved into Shared Libraries instead.

Example 35. Script Block in Declarative Pipeline
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'

                script {
                    def browsers = ['chrome', 'firefox']
                    for (int i = 0; i < browsers.size(); ++i) {
                        echo "Testing the ${browsers[i]} browser"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
