Parallel
Stages in Declarative Pipeline may have a parallel section containing a list of nested stages to be run in parallel. Note that a stage must have one and only one of steps, stages, parallel, or matrix. It is not possible to nest a parallel or matrix block within a stage directive if that stage directive is nested within a parallel or matrix block itself. However, a stage directive within a parallel or matrix block can use all other functionality of a stage, including agent, tools, when, etc.

In addition, you can force your parallel stages to all be aborted when any one of them fails, by adding failFast true to the stage containing the parallel. Another option for adding failfast is adding an option to the pipeline definition: parallelsAlwaysFailFast()

Example 25. Parallel Stages, Declarative Pipeline
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Non-Parallel Stage') {
            steps {
                echo 'This stage will be executed first.'
            }
        }
        stage('Parallel Stage') {
            when {
                branch 'master'
            }
            failFast true
            parallel {
                stage('Branch A') {
                    agent {
                        label "for-branch-a"
                    }
                    steps {
                        echo "On Branch A"
                    }
                }
                stage('Branch B') {
                    agent {
                        label "for-branch-b"
                    }
                    steps {

                    }

                stage('Branch C') {
                    agent {
                        label "for-branch-c"
                    }
                    stages {
                        stage('Nested 1') {
                            steps {
                                echo "In stage Nested 1 within Branch C"
                            }
                        }
                        stage('Nested 2') {
                            steps {
                                echo "In stage Nested 2 within Branch C"
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
