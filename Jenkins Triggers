triggers
The triggers directive defines the automated ways in which the Pipeline should be re-triggered. For Pipelines which are integrated with a source such as GitHub or BitBucket, triggers may not be necessary as webhooks-based integration will likely already be present. The triggers currently available are cron, pollSCM and upstream.

Required No

Parameters None

Allowed Only once, inside the pipeline block.

cron
Accepts a cron-style string to define a regular interval at which the Pipeline should be re-triggered, for example: triggers { cron('H */4 * * 1-5') }

pollSCM
Accepts a cron-style string to define a regular interval at which Jenkins should check for new source changes. If new changes exist, the Pipeline will be re-triggered. For example: triggers { pollSCM('H */4 * * 1-5') }

upstream
Accepts a comma-separated string of jobs and a threshold. When any job in the string finishes with the minimum threshold, the Pipeline will be re-triggered. For example: triggers { upstream(upstreamProjects: 'job1,job2', threshold: hudson.model.Result.SUCCESS) }

The pollSCM trigger is only available in Jenkins 2.22 or later.
